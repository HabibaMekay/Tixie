# ADR: Security Decision

## Context
Our application requires a secure system that ensures safe ticket purchasing while protecting against unauthorized access. The solution should safeguard the server by restricting public API access and preventing unauthorized transactions.

## Decision
We have decided to use OAuth2 for authentication and authorization.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- **Pros:**
  - Stateless authentication with scalable performance
  - Compact and easy to integrate with APIs
- **Cons:**
  - Requires proper token expiration handling to prevent misuse
  - Token revocation is challenging

2. **API Gateway with Authentication**
- **Pros:**
  - Centralized security enforcement
  - Supports rate limiting, API key authentication, and logging
- **Cons:**
  - Can introduce additional latency
  - More complex setup and maintenance

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Secure authentication and authorization management
  - Protects APIs from unauthorized access
  - Enables scalable security with token-based authentication

## Rationale
OAuth2 provides a robust authentication mechanism, ensuring secure access control while minimizing exposure of sensitive APIs. It supports industry best practices for authentication and is widely adopted for modern web applications.
