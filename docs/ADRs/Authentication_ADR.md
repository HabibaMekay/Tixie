# ADR: Authentication Decision

## Context
Our application requires a secure and scalable authentication mechanism to manage user access and protect sensitive data. The solution should support modern authentication standards, be easy to integrate, and provide a seamless user experience.

## Decision
We have decided to use OAuth2 for authorization and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Session-Based Authentication**
   - **Pros:**
     - Simple to implement for small applications.
     - Well-understood and widely used.
   - **Cons:**
     - Not suitable for stateless architectures.
     - Requires server-side session management, which can be complex at scale.

2. **OpenID Connect**
   - **Pros:**
     - Built on top of OAuth2, providing additional identity verification.
     - Strong support for single sign-on (SSO).
   - **Cons:**
     - More complex to implement than OAuth2 with JWT.
     - May introduce additional overhead for applications not requiring SSO.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - OAuth2 provides a robust framework for authorization, allowing third-party applications to access user data securely.
  - JWTs are compact, self-contained tokens that can be easily transmitted and verified, supporting stateless authentication.
  - The combination of OAuth2 and JWT supports scalability and is well-suited for modern web applications.

## Rationale
OAuth2 was chosen for its flexibility and widespread adoption as an industry standard for authorization. JWTs were selected for their efficiency in token-based authentication, enabling stateless and scalable solutions. This combination aligns with our application's security and scalability requirements.
