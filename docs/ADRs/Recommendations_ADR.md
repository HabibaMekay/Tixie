# ADR: Recommendation System Decision

## Context
Our application requires a recommendation system to enhance user experience by providing personalized content suggestions. The solution should be easy to implement, user-friendly, and leverage existing machine learning and mathematical libraries for efficiency and scalability.

## Decision
We have decided to implement the recommendation system using Python, utilizing machine learning libraries.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Custom Algorithm Implementation**
   - **Pros:**
     - Tailored to specific application needs.
     - Full control over the algorithm's behavior.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires significant development time and expertise.
     - Harder to maintain and scale compared to using established libraries.

2. **Third-Party Recommendation Services**
   - **Pros:**
     - Quick to integrate with minimal setup.
     - Often comes with support and maintenance.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited customization and control.
     - Potentially higher costs and dependency on external services.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Python's rich ecosystem of machine learning libraries (such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch) and mathematical libraries (like NumPy and SciPy) make it easy to implement and experiment with various recommendation algorithms.
  - The solution is user-friendly and allows for rapid prototyping and iteration.
  - Leveraging existing libraries reduces development time and increases reliability.
  - Will be easier to transfer to a docker container when attempting to deploy

## Rationale
Python was chosen for its simplicity and the extensive support provided by its machine learning and mathematical libraries. This approach allows us to quickly implement and iterate on recommendation algorithms, ensuring a user friendly and efficient solution that aligns with our application's goals.
