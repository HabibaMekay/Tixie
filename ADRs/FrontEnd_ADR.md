# ADR: Front End Decision

## Context

Our application requires an intuitive and user-friendly design to enhance user satisfaction, ultimately increasing user retention. To achieve this, we need a frontend framework that is both efficient and scalable.

## Decision

We have decided to use **React** for our application due to its flexibility, performance, and strong community support.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. **Tailwind**

- **Pros:**
  - Provides a utility-first approach, leading to faster styling.
  - Highly customizable with configuration options.
  - Reduces the need for writing custom CSS.
- **Cons:**
  - Not a full frontend framework, requiring additional tools like React or Vue.
  - Can lead to messy HTML with excessive class names.
  - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with utility-first CSS.

### 2. **Angular**

- **Pros:**
  - Provides a full-featured framework with built-in solutions (e.g., state management, dependency injection).
  - Strongly typed with TypeScript, reducing runtime errors.
  - Well-suited for large-scale enterprise applications.
- **Cons:**
  - Steeper learning curve compared to React.
  - More opinionated, making customization harder.
  - Can introduce unnecessary complexity for smaller projects.

## Consequences

### **Positive:**

- React enables efficient client-side data binding, reducing server-side workload.
- Supports dynamic loading, improving page load times.
- Compatible with a wide range of browsers.
- Strong ecosystem with reusable components and extensive libraries.

## Rationale

React was chosen due to its component-based architecture, allowing for scalable and maintainable UI development. Its virtual DOM improves performance, and its large community ensures long-term support and innovation.
