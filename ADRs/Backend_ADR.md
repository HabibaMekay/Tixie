# ADR: Backend Framework Decision

## Context
Our application requires a robust and flexible backend framework to handle HTTP requests, manage routing, and integrate seamlessly with our chosen database (PostgreSQL). The framework should support rapid development, have a rich ecosystem of libraries, and be easy to maintain.

## Decision
We have decided to use Express.js as the backend framework for our application.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Django (Python)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Comprehensive framework with built-in features.
     - Strong community support.
   - **Cons:**
     - Heavier and more opinionated than Express.js.
     - Less flexible for projects that require a lightweight solution.

2. **Spring Boot (Java)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Powerful and scalable for large applications.
     - Strong integration with enterprise solutions.
   - **Cons:**
     - More complex setup and steeper learning curve.
     - Overhead for smaller applications.
3. **Flask (Python)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Lightweight and easy to learn.
     - Flexible and allows for a modular application structure.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires additional setup for features like authentication and database integration.
     - Smaller ecosystem compared to Express.js, which requires more custom development.
## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Express.js is lightweight and unopinionated, allowing for flexibility in application structure.
  - It has a rich ecosystem of middleware and libraries, facilitating rapid development and integration with PostgreSQL.
  - The framework is widely used, with extensive documentation and community support.
  - Seamless WebSocket Integration: Express.js can be easily integrated with WebSocket libraries like `Socket.IO`, enabling real-time communication capabilities. This allows handling both HTTP and WebSocket requests within the same application.
  - Middleware Support: Leverage Express.js middleware to handle tasks like authentication and logging before establishing WebSocket connections.
  - Scalability: With the right setup, Express.js and WebSockets can be scaled to handle a large number of concurrent connections.

## Rationale
Express.js was chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and our familiarty with the framework. It also has extensive support provided by its ecosystem. Its ability to integrate well with PostgreSQL and other libraries aligns with our application's requirements for a scalable and maintainable backend solution.
