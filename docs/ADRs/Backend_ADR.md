# ADR: Backend Framework Decision

## Context
Our application requires a robust and efficient backend framework to handle HTTP requests, manage routing, and integrate seamlessly with our chosen database (PostgreSQL). The framework should support rapid development, have a rich ecosystem of libraries, and be easy to maintain. Additionally, it should be self-contained, compile quickly, and offer strong concurrency support for processing multiple ticket sales simultaneously.

## Decision
We have decided to use Go as the backend framework for our application.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Express.js (Node.js)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Rich ecosystem of middleware and libraries.
     - Easy to integrate with PostgreSQL and other services.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires additional setup for features like authentication and database integration.
     - Less efficient for CPU-bound tasks compared to Go.
2. **Django (Python)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Comprehensive framework with built-in features.
     - Strong community support.
   - **Cons:**
     - Heavier and more opinionated than Go.
     - Less flexible for projects that require a lightweight solution.
3. **Spring Boot (Java)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Powerful and scalable for large applications.
     - Strong integration with enterprise solutions.
   - **Cons:**
     - More complex setup and steeper learning curve.
     - Overhead for smaller applications.
4. **Flask (Python)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Lightweight and easy to learn.
     - Flexible and allows for a modular application structure.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires additional setup for features like authentication and database integration.
     - Smaller ecosystem compared to Express.js, which requires more custom development.
## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - **Self-Contained**: Go is self-contained, with many libraries built into the standard library, reducing the need for external dependencies.
  - **Fast Compilation**: Go compiles quickly, making it easy to integrate with Docker and other containerization tools.
  - **Concurrency Support**: Go offers powerful concurrency tools like goroutines and channels, allowing for efficient processing of multiple ticket sales simultaneously.
  - **Performance**: Go is known for its high performance, making it suitable for handling high loads and complex operations.

## Rationale
Go was chosen for its efficiency, simplicity, and strong support for concurrency. Its self-contained nature and fast compilation make it an ideal choice for our application, especially considering future phases involving Docker integration and the need to process multiple ticket sales concurrently.
