# ADR: Payment Handling Decision

## Context
Our application requires a fast and secure ticket payment system. Payments must be processed only once to ensure credibility and avoid duplicate transactions.

## Decision
We have decided to use Stripe as our payment gateway, along with Idempotency Keys to prevent duplicate processing.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. **PayPal**
   - **Pros:**
     - Well-known and widely used, increasing user trust.
     - Provides built-in fraud protection and dispute resolution.
     - Supports multiple currencies and international transactions.
   - **Cons:**
     - Higher transaction fees compared to Stripe.
     - Less developer-friendly API with more rigid integration.
     - Slower processing times in some cases.
     - Limited availability in some countries.

### 2. **Manual Bank Transfers**
   - **Pros:**
     - No additional transaction fees from third-party providers.
     - Suitable for large, one-time payments.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires manual verification, leading to delays.
     - Poor user experience due to lack of instant confirmation.
     - No automatic refund or chargeback protection.

## Consequences

### **Positive:**
- **Stripe**:
  - Provides a secure, PCI-compliant payment solution.
  - Supports various payment methods, including credit cards and digital wallets.
  - Built-in fraud detection and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) compliance.

- **Idempotency Keys**:
  - Ensures that duplicate payment requests do not result in multiple charges.
  - Prevents accidental retries or network failures from causing overcharges.

- **Stripe with Idempotency Keys**:
  - Combines security, flexibility, and reliability in payment processing.
  - Reduces server-side complexity by letting Stripe handle transaction state.
  - Ensures a seamless and trustworthy payment experience for users.

## Rationale
Stripe and Idempotency Keys were chosen due to their ability to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly payment experience. This combination ensures that payments are processed only once, reducing the risk of duplicate charges and improving transaction reliability.
