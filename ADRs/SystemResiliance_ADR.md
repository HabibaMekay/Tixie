# ADR: Resilience Decision

## Context
Our application requires a fast, resilient system that can handle high traffic while maintaining reliability. To achieve this, we will implement rate limiting, circuit breakers, and retries with exponential backoff. These mechanisms will help protect against system overload, prevent cascading failures, and ensure smooth recovery from transient errors.

## Decision
We have decided to use GoBreaker for circuit breaking, RetryableHTTP for handling retries with exponential backoff, and the rate limiter provided in the GoLang extended library.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Istio Service Mesh**
   - **Pros:**
     - Provides built-in circuit breaking, retries, and rate limiting at the service level.
     - Offers observability, security, and traffic control features beyond basic resilience mechanisms.
   - **Cons:**
     - Introduces additional complexity and infrastructure overhead.
     - Requires Kubernetes for deployment, which may not be ideal for all environments.

2. **Custom Middleware Implementation**
   - **Pros:**
     - Fully customizable to meet specific system requirements.
     - Does not depend on third-party libraries or frameworks.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires additional development and maintenance effort.
     - May lead to inconsistencies if not properly implemented.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Improved system stability by preventing cascading failures.
  - Better handling of transient failures with automatic retries and backoff.
  - Protection against excessive request loads with rate limiting.
- **Negative:**
  - Additional configuration and monitoring required for fine-tuning thresholds.
  - Potentially increased latency due to retry mechanisms in certain cases.

## Rationale
The chosen approach aligns with our need for a resilient, scalable system. By leveraging GoBreaker, RetryableHTTP, and GoLangâ€™s built-in rate limiter, we ensure that services can handle failures gracefully, recover efficiently, and maintain optimal performance under high loads. This decision integrates well with our overall microservices architecture, balancing reliability with responsiveness.
