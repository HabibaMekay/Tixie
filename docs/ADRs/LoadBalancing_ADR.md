# ADR: Load Balancing Decision

## Context
Our application requires fast responses to accommodate large numbers of requests without introducing latency issues.

## Decision
We have decided to use HAProxy to distribute the request load efficiently across multiple servers.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Nginx**
- **Pros:**
  - Highly efficient, with a focus on performance and scalability
  - Supports a wide range of features such as load balancing, reverse proxy, and security enhancements
- **Cons:**
  - Primarily designed for serving static content, requiring additional configuration for dynamic load balancing
  - Some advanced load balancing features require external modules

2. **Traefik**
- **Pros:**
  - Built-in support for microservices and cloud-native environments
  - Auto-discovery of new services with dynamic routing
- **Cons:**
  - More complex initial setup compared to HAProxy
  - Some features require a paid enterprise version

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Effective load balancing for improved performance
  - Minimal configuration and setup required
  - High availability and fault tolerance

## Rationale
HAProxy provides a lightweight yet powerful solution for distributing traffic efficiently, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance with minimal configuration.
