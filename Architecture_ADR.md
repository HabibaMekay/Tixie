# ADR: Microservice Architecture Decision

## Context
Our application requires a scalable and flexible architecture to support rapid development, deployment, and maintenance. The architecture should allow for independent scaling of components, facilitate continuous delivery, and improve fault isolation.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt a microservice architecture for our application.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - **Pros:**
     - Simpler to develop and deploy initially.
     - Easier to test as a single unit.
   - **Cons:**
     - Difficult to scale and maintain as the application grows.
     - Changes in one part of the application can affect the entire system.

2. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Encourages reusability and integration of services.
     - Supports heterogeneous environments.
   - **Cons:**
     - Can be complex to implement and manage.
     - Often requires a centralized service bus, which can become a bottleneck.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - **Scalability**: Microservices allow us to scale components independently, optimizing resource management.
  - **Flexibility**: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently, allowing for the use of different technologies and languages.
  - **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one microservice do not necessarily affect others, improving the overall resilience of the application.
  - **Reusability**: Components in the microservice achitecture can be repurposed for other project or even taken from previously completed projects.
## Rationale
The microservice architecture was chosen for its ability to support scalability, flexibility. It aligns with our goals of maintaining a robust and adaptable application that can evolve with changing requirements, and allow for parallel development.
